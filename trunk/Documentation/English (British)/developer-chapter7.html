<br><br>
The language files that are used by Xestia Scanner Server are stored in the 'lang' directory. The language filenames used are typically formatted as ISO 639-1 codes with the “local” dialect appened to it.
<br><br>
An example of this is English (British), as it is the English language it begins with the ISO 639-1 code of en and is then appended with -GB for the “local” dialect making it en-GB. Typically if it's a language specific for a country the local dialect is in capitals, while variations of the language are typically in small letters.
<br><br>
When translating Xestia Scanner Server to another language, the default language of Xestia Scanner Server is English (British). This is the en-GB.lang file in the 'lang' directory and will always contain the most recent language strings. However, if there are already completed and translated files in other languages, you can base the translation from that language if it is easier that way.
<br><br>
The settings in the 'about' tag provide information about the language file. 'name' specifies the name of the language, 'creator' specifies who created the language file while 'mailaddress' specifies an e-mail address (if desired).
<br><br>
The remaining tags contain all of the strings that are used within Xestia Scanner Server.
