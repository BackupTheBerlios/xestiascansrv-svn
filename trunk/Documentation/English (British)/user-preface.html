To deal with the fact that where I live I have several PCs available to work from, I decided to build a miniature server which would help me manage my files, calendar and (eventually) my contacts.
<br><br>
I also decided that I want to print from any PC at home regardless if my main PC is turned on or not which meant attaching the printer to my miniature server.<br><br>As my printer is an all-in-one printer, I couldn't easily access the scanner part of the printer through the network and each operating system had it's own way of accessing scanners. The simple answer was to write some scanner server software which can be managed through a web browser which resulted in Xestia Scanner Server.
<br><br>
To save time for myself, I had forked Kiriwrite so that the advantages which Kiriwrite had would be the same for Xestia Scanner Server such as the UTF-8 support, modular system and multiple language support.
<br><br>
In memory of my Dad who sadly passed away several weeks before the first version of Xestia Scanner Server was completed.
