Changes since version 0.4.0
===========================
- Added Output module system. You can now do whatever you need with the
  pages once they have been compiled through the Output module system.
  The original functionality of writing pages to the output directory is
  in the Normal.pm file in the Modules/System directory.
- Fixed problem in installer script which wouldn't show a more helpful
  error message when trying to load CGI::Lite.
- Fixed problem where pages that are compiled when there is no template 
  database are not written to the output directory even though a file 
  with the page filename given is created.
- Optimise the code using for getting the list of database, presentation
  and output modules.

Changes since version 0.3.0
===========================

- Added mod_perl support.
- Config::Auto is no longer required as Kiriwrite uses it's own 
  mechanism for loading configuration and language files.
- Fixed problem in Documentation where quotation marks were not showing
  properly. This was prevalant in the Developer Documentation when
  giving examples for subroutines.

Changes since version 0.2.0
===========================

- Fixed problem where changing the width and height of the large text
  boxes in the settings where they wouldn't take effect.
- Removed CGI.pm from installer and replaced it with CGI::Lite.
- Added ability to change the amount of pages, templates and filters
  that can be shown.

Changes since version 0.1.0
===========================

- Removed CGI.pm (except installer) and replaced it with CGI::Lite.
- Optimised the speed of getting the filters and templates by only 
  getting the information that is needed when listing the filters and
  the templates.
- Limit of 50 pages, filters and templates can be shown on each browse 
  page. This number is currently not changeable but should be changeable
  in version 0.3.0.
- When compiling databases, the template being used can be overridden 
  for another template so that a new layout can be tested.
- Parts of Kiriwrite have been splitted into several seperate library 
  files. Each library file consists of a section (such as the database, 
  page, filter, template, compile and settings).
- Added a setting for changing the width of the text area box.
- Added a setting for changing the height of the text area box.
- Replaced XML-based configuration files and language files with a basic 
  'INI-style' format.
