Changes for future releases
===========================

- Allow different encoding formats to be used when compiling instead of 
  UTF-8 which will probably be implemented within the output modules.
- Code optimisation where the if statements are condensed into one line so
  that less space is used among other improvements.

Changes implemented in 0.5.0
============================

- Implemented Output Module system.

Changes implemented in 0.3.0
============================

- Added the ability to switch off and on a filter.
- Removed CGI.pm from the installer script.
- Added ability to change the amount of pages, templates and filters that
  can be viewed.

Changes implemented in 0.2.0
============================

- Add setting for altering the size of the large textarea boxes.
- Optimise the speed of getting filters and templates when viewing them 
  as a list.
- Allow a limit on the amount of pages viewed on each page to reduce CPU 
  and Database load.
- Apply the same from the above to the template and filter lists.
- Attempt to replace the usage of the CGI Perl module with CGI::Lite.
- Possibly replace the use of XML files used for the configuration file 
  and language files to improve the speed of Kiriwrite.
- Add overwrite template ability when compiling.
- Optimise the speed of Kiriwrite in general (seperating the code into 
  smaller files perhaps stored in a new directory called lib).
