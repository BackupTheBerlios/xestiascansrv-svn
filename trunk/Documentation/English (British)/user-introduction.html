			<span class="pagetitle">Introduction</span><br><br>Xestia Scanner Server is software which allows you to use your scanner over a network so that it can be shared with several users or several PCs using a web browser based interface which the image is then outputted and then exported. Instead of one scanner per user which may well be hardly ever used, having one scanner per group would save money as fewer scanners would be used and save time (plus stress) in maintenance due to few scanner needing to be looked after.<br><br>
There is a modular system available for outputting the scanner image into several formats and also several options for exporting the image (To download via the web browser and send the image through email). This can be easily extended to support newer (and older) image formats or different exporting methods as needed.<br><br>
For using with a group of users, you can manage what the scanners, output modules and export modules the user can or cannot use.<br><br>
The documentation is split into three parts, the user documentation (which is this part), the developer documentation (for writing new modules or language files) and the tutorial documentation (the basics and how to use Xestia Scanner Server).<br><br>
Xestia Scanner Server uses the SANE (Scanner Access Made Easy) software which allows the scanner server to be used as many operating systems as possible which can run SANE.
